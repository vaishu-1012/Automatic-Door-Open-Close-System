# Password Based Door Lock System
Password-based-door-lock-system-using-Arduino-UNO Password Based Door Lock System using Arduino UNO is a simple project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system. Traditional lock systems using mechanical lock and key mechanism are being replaced by new advanced techniques of locking system. These techniques are an integration of mechanical and electronic devices and are highly intelligent. One of the prominent features of these innovative lock systems is their simplicity and high efficiency. Such an automatic lock system consists of electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a password. This output load can be a motor or a lamp or any other mechanical/electrical load.

Here, we developed an electronic code lock system using Arduino UNO (a Password based Door Lock System using Arduino UNO), which provides control to the actuating the load. It is a simple embedded system with input from the keyboard and the output being actuated accordingly.

This system demonstrates a Password based Door Lock System using Arduino UNO, wherein once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Again, if another person arrives, it will ask to enter the password. If the password is wrong, then door would remain closed, denying access to the person. Principle Behind the Circuit The main component in the circuit is Arduino UNO. In this project, a 4×3 Matrix Keypad is used to enter the password. The password which is entered is compared with the predefined password.

If the entered password is correct, then the system opens the door by rotating door motor and displays the status of door on LCD. If the password is wrong, then the door is remains closed and displays “Password is wrong” on LCD. Components Required Hardware Requirements Arduino UNO, 4×4 Matrix Keypad, 16×2 LCD, Servo Motor, 10KΩ Potentiometer, Connecting wires and Power Supply.

How to Design Circuit of Password based Door Lock System? Password based door lock system using Arduino UNO circuit design uses five major components – an Arduino UNO, a Servo Motor, a 4×4 Matrix Keypad and a 16×2 LCD.
